                  I am a User Experience Technologist based in Austin, Texas. I
                  enjoy carefully investigating human experience and behavior. I
                  have a strong passion to understand how humans interact with
                  multiple interfaces. I dream up new ways to spark and distill
                  insight, and inspire teams and clients to address people's
                  needs through bold, optimistic design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Management Information
                  Systems at the University of Houston in May 2020.

                  My passion for UX Design and Research started while I was
                  enrolled in a 2 year rotational program at an Energy
                  Technology company. I was presented with an opportunity to
                  rotate with the HQ UX team and have since been involved with
                  them carefully curating designs and research for the business.

                  Aside from this, I enjoy running, participating in marathons
                  and being a full time dog mom to my puppy,{' '}
