    description: [
      'The experience users or customers have can greatly affect how they feel about a business. It is important to understand how a user or a client feels about their user journey on a specific website. During my preliminary research for DS Store, an E-commerce website for Baker Hughes, I found a lot of dissatisfaction amongst users of this application.',
      "I decided to follow a typical User's Journey on this website and came across many discrepancies within the site myself.",
      'I then used a company wide used Heuristic Evaluation template that focused on every aspect of the site such as the Homepage, Task Orientation, Navigation and IA (Information Architecture), Forms and Data Entry, Trust and Credibility, Writing, Page Layout, and Search. I tested each functionality in the template and provided a score of 1 to -1 with 1 being exceptional and -1 being dissatisfaction.',
      'After scoring each functionality, I then anaylzed my data and catgorized each aspect of the website and produced a raw score as well as a score percentage. I produced visual data for my business owners and stakeholders that highlighted what areas the website excels in vs what areas the website needs immediate attention to increase the User Journey.',
      'After carefully conducting a Heuristic Evaluation on both the Log In and Guest versions of the website, I was able to present my recommendations as well as actionable items to both the business and the project stakeholders.',

      'For my Google UX Course project, I conducted a Competitive Audit. A Competitive Audit is just one tool to explore ideas for designs, so we can learn from others about what has worked and not worked. By conducting a Competitive Audit I was able to identify my key competitors, review the products that my competitors offer, understand how my competitors position themselves in the market, examine what my competition does well and what they could do better, and consider how my competitors talk about themselves. ',
      'I incorporated both direct and indirect competitors in my audit as it was important to audit a wide range of products that compete with mine to get a full picture of the landscape. This Audit helped inform my design process such as "How did my competitors approach designing their products"? Knowing what others have done can help me make better design decisions for my own product. This Audit also helped me solve usability problems such as "Is my competitor\'s website difficult to use"? This helped me identify what to avoid adding to my own application.',
      "This Audit also helped reveal gaps in the market. For example, are there user needs my competitors do not meet? Lastly, this Audit provided me with reliable evidence because design ideas are most successful when there's a deep understanding of business needs and market gaps. Competitive Audits are a huge part of gathering that information and knowing all of these things can help a product save time, money, and energy.",

    description: [
      'For my Google UX Course project, I created a highly effective Research Study Plan. There are seven elements that I included: the project background, the research goals, the detailed research questions, the key performance indicators or KPIs, the methodology, the participants, and the script or questions I asked the participants.',
      'The first element of my plan is the project background. The project background answers the question: "What led me to conduct this research"? I created a mobile application for a local restaurant that allows its users to place orders online through this application.  This led me to determine "What design problems am I trying to solve? And how will the results of the research impact my design decisions"? I used these answers to create goals for my research project.',
      'The goals for the research project helped me understand key problems such as determining whether this application was difficult to use. I needed to consider the ease of use in order to understand why customers join this app and leave or stay. After I determined my research goals, I developed detailed research questions for my plan such as "how long does it take a user to find and order an item from the menu of the app? And what can I learn from the user flow or the steps that users take to place an order"?',
      'I measured my progress using KPIâ€™s such as time on task and conversion rates. For my app, one thing I wanted to track is how many users in the research study complete their search for a menu item and how long they spend on this task. The next element of my plan is the methodology. This is where I documented the steps I took to conduct my research. I needed to determine "How will I collect data and how will I analyze the data once I get it"? To find out if users are able to find and order in the new app, I conducted a survey of prospective users. I recruited frequent customers of this restaurant as well as of competing restaurants in the area to participate in the survey and help determine next steps in my research process.',

      'Building Wireframes - Brazilian Steakhouse Food Delivery App (Google UX Course)',
    description: [
      'For my Google UX Project, I am in the process of designing a mobile food delivery app for a fictionial restaraunt in the Texas area.',
      'Before creating a functioning prototype, I started by sketching out and eventually turning my designs into  lo-fi Wireframes using Figma. Each Wireframe I created ensures that I solved a real problem users typically faced while working with food delivery apps on their phones. I chose to stick with a lower amount of complexity as I was inspired by my research and wanted to get ideas designed quickly.',
      'While designing my Wireframes, I incorporated my knowledge of Gestalt Principles. Gestalt Principles describes how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects.',
      'For the first principle, Similarity, I wanted to keep "like with like" for consistency. For example, in the Rewards page, I made sure that the placeholders for icons are the same shape and size in all my  wireframes.',
      'Next, by using Proximity, I ensured that I placed buttons such as "Place Order", "Sign In" and "Regsiter", realtively close to the content to make a connection between the two elements.',
      'For the last principle, Common Region, I created a border around the navigation bar. This design tip helps users recognize that the icons in the navigation bar are more important than others and are perceived to be grouped together.',
      'I used simple rectangles, shapes and icons to get my word across in my designs. My main focus while creating these Wireframes were functionality. After completing these Wireframes, I went on to create prototypes in Figma and conducted a Usability Study for my Wireframes.',
